# NYC-Trip-Data
1. Install the following libraries:- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, csv, seaborn, tabulate, and datetime. Use the following command: pip install ‘library name’ (without the quotes)

2. I have created an empty file ‘green_output.csv’ to store the data set after downloading it. 

3. For each of the codes run as ‘python filename.py’. 
	
4. Run Dataset.py first if data set is not already present.

5. For Dataset.py I have commented the download csv file section since it is needed only once, after it is  stored in the local filesystem. We can then access the data by storing it as a Data Frame.
